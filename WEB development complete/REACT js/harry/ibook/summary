step1:

1. first we build backend for which we create package:
   "npm init"

2. we install express and mongoose:
   we know mongoose will be used for data storage but why expres
   EXPRESS:
   Node JS is a fast JavaScript runtime environment that we use to build server-side applications, but it does not know how to perform serving files, handling requests, and handling HTTP methods, so this is where express js comes in.

3. Now we create db.js for connecting backend to mongo DB
   for connection use this URL and replace ibook with the name you want to create your database.
   URL: "mongodb+srv://Admin:abbottabad18@cluster0.fvlusjk.mongodb.net/ibookDB";
   create connecttomongoose method with mongoose.connect(URL)

4. install Nodemon

5. SETUP INDEX.JS:
   import connecttomongose and express
   create end pointsa[app.get()] and listen[app.listen()] point and give port other than 1 used for react (3000)

6. SETUP ROUTES:
   the main file for routes is index.js but for better files structure and management we create new folder
   create routes folder for routes where all endpoints and APIs will be created
   1)auth.js 2)notes.js

7. create database models ie 1)User 2)Notes
   create schemas for all models

8. use express validator in auth.js for authentication processes

9. setup thunder client and create new collection for new app and specific folder for each API
